Mac is not a recommended platform to develop Unreal Engine Project. 

Several things need to be noticed:  

+ Do not update your Mac to the latest macOS Ventura 13.0, as the Xcode will be incompatible.
+ Do not use the latest Xcode 14, as the Unreal Engine only support Xcode 13.0, and Do not forget to turn off the update automatically.
